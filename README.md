#Walmart Trip Catagorization
Walmart currently employs a proprietary method to catogorize shopping trips into 38 distinct types. For example these trip types may be: a customer may make a small daily dinner trip, a weekly large grocery trip, a trip to buy gifts for an upcoming holiday, or a seasonal trip to buy clothes. This is a interesting supervised non-binary classification problem that we beleived we could attempt to replicate. So we have set out to create a multi-class predictive model that, given a limited set of customer behavior features, predicts the shopping trip type.
